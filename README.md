# Overview

The Manage Inventory App is a simple and versatile tool designed for a ficticious "art supplies" company. But, it could be used for any company that wants to manage their inventory, the app allows you to perform CRUD operations and interact with your data. 

We used this project as a start-up on .NET development. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to articulate within the .NET development ecosystem, design and develop a .NET application, develop as a productive team member, and teach one another the principles of development in a team environment. 

The tests have been added to a folder named tests and were zipped to avoid conflicts with the actual project. (Since testing with Bunit requires you to start a new .NET project).

# Development Environment

The application was built using VS Code, .NET, and Blazor. 

We used Azure for project planning, management, and deployment.

* [Original deployment](https://dev.azure.com/Team09CSE325/ManageInventoryNET/) This repository in github was created just in case you couldn't access the Azure Devops repository due to recent policy changes.

# Future Work

* The dashboard table is missing Ordering features, users should be able to order their data to see what they need.   
* Testing can be extended to many other operations such as page rendering or product filters.  
* The styling was kept in a basic stage because of time constrains, but as time allows, the project can gain variety and even more accessibility to make it more engaging and user friendly.
